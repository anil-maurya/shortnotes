# JavaScript Design Pattern

A design pattern in software engineering is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. These patterns allow us to reuse code structure for specific problems.

Advantages :

* They provide generic templates that can solve a multitude of common problems

* Other developers can build upon a pattern, so less time is wasted on code structure

* Design patterns provide optimized solutions, so they reduce the size of a codebase

* They are the most optimized solution that has been derived from experienced programmers, so you can trust the results and efficiency


## Types of Design Patterns

1. Creational Design Patterns

	creational patterns allow us to represent an object or group or related objects. 
	 
	 - the simple factory
	 - the factory method 
	 - prototype 
	 - builder
	 - singleton pattern 
	 - abstract factory

2. Structural Design Patterns

 Concern `class/object` composition and relationships between objects. They let you add new functionalities to objects so that restructuring some parts of the system does not affect the rest. Hence, the entire system does not need to change when some parts of structure change.

 - adapter
 - composite
 - bridge
 - decorator
 - flyweight
 - proxy
 - facade pattern

3. Behavioral Design Patterns

	behavioral design patterns are concerns with the responsibilities between objects by outlining the patterns for communication between objects. 
	 - Chain of responsibility
	 - Observer
	 - strategy
	 - template method
	 - command
	 - iterator
	 - memento
	 - state

4. Architectural Design Pattern

	a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context. While they may look like design patterns, architectural design patterns have a broader scope.
		
	 - MVC
	 - MVP
	 - MVVM


## Module Pattern

Advantage of Module
 
 - Avoid Collisions (Namespace)
 - Reusability 
 - Maintainability
